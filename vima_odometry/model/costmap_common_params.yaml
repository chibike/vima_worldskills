# Obstacle range: determines the maximum range sensor reading that will result in an obstacle being put into the costmap
obstacle_range: 2.5 #0.4

#The "raytrace_range" parameter determines the range to which we will raytrace freespace given a sensor reading. Setting it to x meters as we have above means that the robot will attempt to clear out space in front of it up to x meters away given a sensor reading.
raytrace_range: 3.0 #0.1

# Given our robot is circular we will be using robot_radius not footprint

# The inflation radius should be set to the maximum distance from obstacles at which a cost should be incurred. For example, setting the inflation radius at x meters means that the robot will treat all paths that stay x meters or more away from obstacles as having equal obstacle cost.
